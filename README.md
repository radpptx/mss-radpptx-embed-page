Embed RadPPTX Pages

This is the source code for the MSS RadPPTX Embed Page WordPress Plugin. It is a simple plugin made using wordpress/create-block. Once you install and enable the plugin, you will have a new Block in your Gutenberg editor called "MSS RadPPTX Embed." Using this Block, you can embed any RadPPTX page to your own WordPress website by specifying the content ID (which you can find in the My Teaching section of your My Account page). The Block with take up 100% of the width of its container and dynamically change its height to fit the entirety of your RadPPTX page.

Currently, only RadPPTX content that is publicly available (i.e. published with visibility set to "public - free" or "unlisted") can be embedded with this plugin.
